My research centres on machine learning and computer vision approaches for medical data interpretation and analysis. We aim at 1. streamlining clinical workflows and improving patient outcomes with easy-to-deploy, robust, and trustworthy machine learning approaches; 2. enhancing human-machine collaborations in clinical settings through both novel algorithms and user studies; 3. accelerating medical science research, especially those involving imaging phenotypes, with machine learning approaches. Topics of our research include but are not limited to the following: 

- Multimodal machine learning for healthcare data (e.g., image, signal, and language)
- Domain generalization and uncertainty modeling for easy-to-deploy and trustworthy machine learning
- Few-/zero-shot learning for improving data efficiency on long-tailed medical data
- Machine learning for medical scientific discoveries (e.g., cardiovascular science) 
- Applications of the above learning approaches in addressing clinical and medical research challenges
