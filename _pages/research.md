My research centres on machine learning and computer vision approaches for medical data interpretation and analysis. We aim at 1. streamlining clinical workflows and improving patient outcomes with easy-to-deploy, robust, and trustworthy machine learning approaches; 2. enhancing human-machine collaborations in clinical settings through both novel algorithms and user studies; 3. accelerating medical science research, especially those involving imaging phenotypes, with machine learning approaches. Topics of our research include but are not limited to the following: 

- Multimodal learning for medical image, signal, language, and more
- Data-efficient, trustworthy, and/or privacy-preserving machine learning for medical imaging
- Human-machine collaboration and human factor/skill analysis in medical imaging
- Applications of the above approaches in addressing clinical and research challenges (e.g., for cardiac imaging)
