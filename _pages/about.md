I am a Lecturer in Healthcare Imaging at the [Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/). My research centres on data-efficient, robust, and user-friendly machine learning approaches for medical image/signal computing. Prior to joining Oxford, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher on machine learning for cardiovascular science at the [Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/institute-clinical-sciences/) from May 2023 to April 2024. Before that, I obtained my PhD in Computing Research from the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/).


Research Interest
------
**Keywords:** Medical image computing, Machine learning, Robustness, Uncertainty, Human-machine collaboration, Medical ultrasound, MRI

My research centres on machine learning and computer vision approaches for medical data interpretation and analysis. Topics of our research include but are not limited to the following: 

- Multimodal machine learning for healthcare data (e.g., image, signal, and language)
- Domain generalization and uncertainty modeling for easy-to-deploy and trustworthy machine learning
- Few-/zero-shot learning for improving data efficiency on long-tailed medical data
- Machine learning for medical scientific discoveries (e.g., cardiovascular science) 
- Applications of the above learning approaches in addressing clinical and medical research challenges

We are also part of the [Oxford Biomedical Image Analysis Cluster (BioMedIA)](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/).


Opening
------
We are looking for highly motivated students to work on machine learning for medical image/data computing. Please check the [Vacancies page](https://cheng-01037.github.io/vacancies/) for more details.
