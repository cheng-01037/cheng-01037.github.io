I am a Lecturer in Healthcare Imaging at the [Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/). Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/institute-clinical-sciences/) from May 2023 to April 2024. Before that, I obtained my PhD in Computing Research from the [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) in April 2023.


Research Interest
------
Medical image computing, Machine Learning, Medical ultrasound, MRI, Cardiac imaging

- Multimodal machine learning for healthcare data (e.g., image, signal, and language)
- Domain generalization and uncertainty modeling for trustworthy machine learning for medical image computing
- Few-/zero-shot learning for data-efficient machine learning in medical image computing
- Machine learning for medical scientific discoveries (e.g., cardiovascular sciences) 

We are also part of the [Oxford Biomedical Image Analysis Cluster (BioMedIA)](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/).

Opening
------
We are looking for highly motivated PhD students to work on machine learning for medical image/data computing. Prospective students will have a good first degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering or other related disciplines. Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested.
