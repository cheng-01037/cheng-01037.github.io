We are seeking highly self-motivated students to pursue a PhD in medical image/multimodal data computing at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. 

Candidates are expected to have a strong background in a relevant STEM discipline, and have experience, including a proven publication track-record, in one or more of the following areas: computer vision, machine learning and/or medical imaging.

You should also have:
- A passion in solving real-world healthcare challenges using computational tools.
- Sufficient communication and academic writing skills, demonstrated through a publication track record and/or presentations at scientific events.
- Strong analytical, problem-solving, organizational, and interpersonal skills.
- A good (1st or strong upper 2nd with honors) undergraduate degree or equivalent in a relevant STEM discipline.

Potential PhD topics include but are not limited to the following: 

- Fundamental approaches for improving the robustness, trustworthiness, and user-friendliness of machine learning models for medical image/multimodal data computing.
- Medical image/multimodal data computing approaches for improving the overall efficiency and patient outcomes in clinical environments with various levels of resource and expertise. 
- Medical image/multimodal data computing approaches for supporting healthcare research, with a particular focus on cardiology research.

The students will join a multi-disciplinary research group of approximately 20 PhD students and postdocs focused on diverse topics in medical image/multimodal data computing. The group is primarily led by Prof. Alison Noble and co-led by Dr. Cheng Ouyang and is based at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Engineering Science. The students will also have the opportunitiy to collaborate with world-leading scientists and clinicians at Oxford, Imperial College London, and beyond. 

Feel free to get in touch if you are interested!
