We are seeking highly self-motivated students to pursue a PhD in medical image analysis at the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. 

*Please note that due to the high volume of inquiries as the deadline approaches, I may not be able to respond to all emails. A lack of reply is not a reflection of your qualifications or potential. Thank you for your understanding.*

Candidates are expected to have a strong background in a relevant STEM discipline, and have experience, including a proven publication track-record, in one or more of the following areas: computer vision, machine learning and/or medical imaging.

You should also have:
- A passion in solving real-world healthcare challenges using computational tools.
- Sufficient communication and academic writing skills, demonstrated through a publication track record and/or presentations at scientific events.
- Strong analytical, problem-solving, organizational, and interpersonal skills.
- A good (1st or strong upper 2nd with honors) undergraduate degree or equivalent in a relevant STEM discipline.

Potential PhD topics include but are not limited to the following: 

- Multi-modal machine learning for medical image, signal, language, and more
- Agentic workflows for medical image analysis
- Machine learning for human factor/skill analysis in medical imaging
- Human-in-the-loop learning and inference approaches for medical imaging 

The students will join a multi-disciplinary research group of approximately 20 PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, led by two faculty members, focused on diverse topics in machine learning / human-machine collaboration for medical imaging. The students will collaborate with world-leading clinicians and scientists. 

Feel free to get in touch if you are interested!
