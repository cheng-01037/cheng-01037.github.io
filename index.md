## About Me

Hi there!

I am a research assistant and PhD student at the [BioMedIA group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing).

My research is mainly about cutting-edge techniques for robust and cost-effective cardiac magnetic resonance image computing.

Before joining Imperial College London, I did my M.S. at the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan - Ann Arbor](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/).

## Research Interests

- **Medical image computing** Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and post-processing

## News

- **[June. 2021]** Our paper about [robust cardiac magnetic resonance image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01079) accepted to MICCAI 2021.
- **[Aug. 2020]** Our paper about [self-supervised few-shot medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09886) accepted to ECCV 2020.
