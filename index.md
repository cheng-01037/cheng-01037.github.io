## About Me

Hi there!

I am a postdoctoral research associate at the [Computational Cardiac Imaging group](https://oreganlab.org/), [Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/institute-clinical-sciences/). I am also with the [BioMedIA group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), where I obtained my PhD degree in Computing Research in May 2023.

**Actively pursuing faculty roles in biomedical engineering/electrical engineering/computer science, specifically in digital healthcare/medical image computing. Open to relevant opportunities - please reach out!**

## Research Interests

- **Medical image computing**: Pioneering the development of **advanced**, **robust**, and **data-efficient** algorithms for medical image computing, these techniques are specifically crafted for practical implementation in both **clinical settings** and **research-oriented workflows**.
- **Key words**: Domain Adaptation & Generalization; Uncertainty Estimation; Few-shot Learning; Semantic Image Segmentation; MRI Reconstruction
