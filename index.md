## About Me

Hi there!

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the [Computational Cardiac Imaging group](https://oreganlab.org/), [Institute of Clinical Sciences, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/institute-clinical-sciences/). I am also with the [BioMedIA group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing), where I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computing Research. 

## Research Interests

- **Medical image computing**: Pioneering the development of **trustworthy**, **robust**, and **data-efficient** algorithms for medical image computing, these techniques are specifically crafted for practical implementation in both **clinical settings** and **research-oriented workflows**.
- **Key words**: Uncertainty Estimation; Domain generalization; Few-shot Learning; Semantic Image Segmentation; MRI Reconstruction; Cardiac Imaging
