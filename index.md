## About Me

Hi there!

I am a research assistant and PhD candidate at the [BioMedIA group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing).

My research is mainly about cutting-edge techniques for robust and cost-effective cardiac magnetic resonance image computing.

## Research Interests

- **Medical image computing** Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and post-processing, with a special focus on improving cost-effectiveness and robustness for the algorithms.
