## About Me

Hi there!

I am a research assistant and PhD candidate at the [BioMedIA group](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/), [Department of Computing, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing).

My research is mainly about cutting-edge techniques for robust and cost-effective cardiac magnetic resonance image computing.

## Research Interests

- **Medical image computing** Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and post-processing

## News
- **[June. 2022]** Our paper about [robust medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01737) was accepted to MICCAI 2022. 
- **[May. 2022]** An invitated talk *Generalizing deep-learning-based medical image segmentation across domains and classes* is given to the Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis Laboratory at NIH Clinical Center, lead by [Prof. Ronald M. Summers](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/ronald-summers). 
- **[Nov. 2021]** Our new preprint about [single-source domain generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12525) is online on Arxiv.
- **[Jun. 2021]** Our paper about [robust cardiac magnetic resonance image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01079) was accepted to MICCAI 2021.
- **[Aug. 2020]** Our paper about [self-supervised few-shot medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09886) was accepted to ECCV 2020.
